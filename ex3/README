Different function on the list:
-Function that's get a list of string and return a string
with all the elements of the list
- Function that's get a list of numbers and return their average
- Function that's get two list and return true if
one is a cyclic permutation of the other
-A function that's for a n and a list of number return the histogram until n
-A function to decompose a natural n to a product of prime number
-A function that's return all the combination lst1 members
with lst2 members (cartesian multiplication)
-A function to get couple of numbers from a list,
with the sum for each couple is n

==================
=  Questions:    =
==================

1- My code will return true, because 'bcda' is a cyclic permutation of 'abcd'
with m=3 and strings act like list (for what I used)
2- My code will return [0, 1, 1],
because 0 appear 0 times, 1 one time and 2 one time
and we don't taking care of numbers over 2
3- My code will return [], the for is running on range(2,1) (nothing)
 so the program doesn't come in the loop and the list stays empty
4- My code will return [(0, 2)], because this the only couple in
 the list with sum equal to 2, and I'me checking every time that
 the same couple isn't in the return list
